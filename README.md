# RouteBuilder
A Python Flask app to map a route between two points. Relies heavily on Leaflet. This was my first time hosting static files on AWS S3. Glad it went smoothly.

To-do List:
- Change page title, heading
- Add "use current location" feature
- Allow for point-by-point route building (i.e. one-click-at-a-time w/o addresses as input)
- Add GeoJSON data to allow for finding OSM points
