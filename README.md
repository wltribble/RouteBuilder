# RouteBuilder
A Python Flask app to map a route between two points. Relies heavily on Leaflet. Also, this was my first time hosting static files on AWS S3, and I can't believe it took me this long...

To-do List:
- Change page title, heading
- Add "use current location" feature
- Add GeoJSON data to allow for finding OSM points
